# Note-Taker

## Description
The Note-Taker app is used to take notes. The app can record the user's notes and for the users to save it. The user is also able to delete the note if they wish. 

## Challenges 
Some of the challenges I faced when I was working on this app is trying to figure out what parts of my code is broken. I had a few challenges and asking for a second pair of eyes before figuring out what was wrong with my code before it worked. I also have trouble figuring out how to deploy a live site as well on Heroku through my terminal.
